# OG_hyp_test

The objective of this project is to show a quick multiple non-linear regression method which uses commonly available data for individual horizontal wells in a given field, and also honors first principles relating to the distribution of error for this particular application. The method is useful for two objectives:
<ul>
  <li>rapid estimation of EURs for new drilling, and
  <li>hypthesis testing the influence of parameters under investigation for causal influence (example: the influence of cluster spacing on wells in a given field at various spacings, completion fluid loads, and completion sand loads).
