The objective of this project is to demonstrate and compare methods for estimating horizontal well EUR (estimated ultimate recovery), herein treated as EUR/ft (EUR per foot of laterally drilled wellbore) The methods will use commonly available data for individual horizontal wells in a given field and aim to honor first principles relating to the mechanics of reservoir productivity. 

The first method uses a frequentist approach to mixed linear & non-linear regression. This method is straightforward and useful for engineers more comfortable with a frequentist approach to statistical estimation.

Later phases will add Bayesian statistical and ML-based approaches, then compare the results, implementations, and relative advantages between the approaches.
