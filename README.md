This project will demonstrate and compare methods for estimating horizontal well EUR (estimated ultimate recovery), herein treated as EUR/ft (EUR per foot of laterally drilled wellbore). The methods will use commonly available data for individual horizontal wells in a given field, and aim to honor first principles relating to the mechanics of reservoir productivity.

The first method ('regression_frequentist.ipynb') uses a frequentist approach to mixed linear & non-linear regression. This method is straightforward and useful for analysts more comfortable with a frequentist approach to statistical estimation.

Later phases will add Bayesian statistical and ML-based approaches, then compare the results, implementations, and relative advantages between the approaches.
